Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time.The technique is used across many fields of study, from geology to behaviour to economics. 
The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.

The repository contains time series analysis on electricity production.

Objective: The objective of this project was to predict and forecast the Electric Production using historical data spanning from 01-01-1985 to 01-01-2018.

Process: 

1. Data Ingesiton

2. Eda of the data

3. processing of the data

4. model building

5. model evalution

Results: ARIMA model achieved Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 8.5 and the SARIMAX model achieved RMSE 5.5. 
These results demonstrate that SARIMAx model gave good result than ARIMA .
